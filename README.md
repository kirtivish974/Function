🧑‍💻 Functions vs Methods
Learn to distinguish standalone functions (created with def) from methods, which are functions tied to class objects—a core OOP foundation.

⚙️ Arguments & Parameters Mastery
Gain confidence in using positional, keyword, default, *args, and **kwargs. These unlock flexibility for all coding scenarios, from basic scripts to advanced libraries.

🏗️ Multiple Ways to Define & Call
Practice various function definitions: standard, parameterized, with defaults, and anonymous (lambda). Recognize when and why to use each pattern for real-world readability and efficiency.

🔄 Return Statement Power
Use return not just to output values, but to control data flows and chain computations—crucial in modular code design.

🔁 Iterators vs Iterables Clarity
Understand that iterators retain state while iterables provide values. Mastering __iter__() and __next__() means cleaner loops and custom data structures.

⚡ Generators: Lazy, Memory-Smart Code
Use yield to build efficient generators. These are vital for big data; they don’t hog memory, and they can model infinite streams (like logs or live data feeds).

🤏 Lambda Functions: Concise Logic
Lambda functions shine for short, throwaway logic. They’re often used with map, filter, and customized sorting—this saves space and boosts readability.

🔗 Functional Trio: map, filter, reduce
Map applies transforms, filter pulls selections, and reduce collapses lists to single results. Knowing their patterns makes tough data tasks easier and your Python code more “pythonic”.

📝 Manual Step-Through—Reduce Example
Tracing reduce step-by-step builds intuition on how functional programming workflows process data—helping debug and optimize solutions.

Key Takeaway 💡:
Becoming fluent in Python functions—from basics to functional programming constructs—enables writing modular, reusable, and scalable code. Mastery of these patterns is foundational for data science, machine learning, and all serious Python development.
